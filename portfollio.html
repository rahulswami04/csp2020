	   <h5> This is my first project in AP Computer Science. Our group created a semi-snake game with out own animations, moving the snake around the page through different while loops. The snake head starts at a certain point, and moves up in the loop toward an apple. It eats the apple, and then the apple dissappears and moves to another location. The snake continues to move in its set loop, and comes across the next apple, and eats it, and so on. At the end of the program, we made it so the snake eventually collides with the wall, and it stops and turns grey in color. After this, we added in a prompt, saying "Game Over. You died :(". <h5>
